# SARS-CoV Drug Prediction App

This repository contains the source code for the [web application](https://sars-drug-bioactivity.herokuapp.com/) built to predict the inhibitory action of molecules towards coronavirus 3C-like proteinase. This prediction model is described in the [sars_inhibitor_prediction](https://github.com/hamiq/sars_inhibitor_prediction) repository.

This application is built using the Streamlit web framework and has been deployed on Heroku. It uses both Python and Java buildpacks, requiring both the requirements.txt and pom.xml files along with the Procfile used by Heroku.
